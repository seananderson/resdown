> Research Scientist (*RES*) dossier + Markdown (*down*) 

Unofficial Markdown template and R code to produce dossiers for Fisheries and
Oceans Canada Research Scientists under the Career Progression Management
Framework.

The dossier format includes considerable cross referencing of "Annex" evidence
in a custom format. The markdown file `dossier.md` is processed by `make.R` to
generate the cross references and render the document into a `.docx` file that
can be copied into the official template with (hopefully) minimal
modifications. A `.html` and `.pdf` version can also be generated for faster
iteration while writing.
